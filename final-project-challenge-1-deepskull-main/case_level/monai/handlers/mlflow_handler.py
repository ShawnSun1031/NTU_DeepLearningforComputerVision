class MLFlowHandler:
    """
    MLFlowHandler defines a set of Ignite Event-handlers for the MLFlow tracking logics.
    It can be used for any Ignite Engine(trainer, validator and evaluator).
    And it can track both epoch level and iteration level logging, then MLFlow can store
    the data and visualize.
    The expected data source is Ignite ``engine.state.output`` and ``engine.state.metrics``.

    Default behaviors:
        - When EPOCH_COMPLETED, track each dictionary item in
          ``engine.state.metrics`` in MLFlow.
        - When ITERATION_COMPLETED, track expected item in
          ``self.output_transform(engine.state.output)`` in MLFlow, default to `Loss`.

    Usage example is available in the tutorial:
    https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/3d_segmentation/unet_segmentation_3d_ignite.ipynb.

    Args:
        tracking_uri: connects to a tracking URI. can also set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment
            variable to have MLflow find a URI from there. in both cases, the URI can either be
            a HTTP/HTTPS URI for a remote server, a database connection string, or a local path
            to log data to a directory. The URI defaults to path `mlruns`.
            for more details: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.set_tracking_uri.
        epoch_logger: customized callable logger for epoch level logging with MLFlow.
            Must accept parameter "engine", use default logger if None.
        iteration_logger: customized callable logger for iteration level logging with MLFlow.
            Must accept parameter "engine", use default logger if None.
        output_transform: a callable that is used to transform the
            ``ignite.engine.state.output`` into a scalar to track, or a dictionary of {key: scalar}.
            By default this value logging happens when every iteration completed.
            The default behavior is to track loss from output[0] as output is a decollated list
            and we replicated loss value for every item of the decollated list.
            `engine.state` and `output_transform` inherit from the ignite concept:
            https://pytorch.org/ignite/concepts.html#state, explanation and usage example are in the tutorial:
            https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/modules/batch_output_transform.ipynb.
        global_epoch_transform: a callable that is used to customize global epoch number.
            For example, in evaluation, the evaluator engine might want to track synced epoch number
            with the trainer engine.
        state_attributes: expected attributes from `engine.state`, if provided, will extract them
            when epoch completed.
        tag_name: when iteration output is a scalar, `tag_name` is used to track, defaults to `'Loss'`.

    For more details of MLFlow usage, please refer to: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html.
