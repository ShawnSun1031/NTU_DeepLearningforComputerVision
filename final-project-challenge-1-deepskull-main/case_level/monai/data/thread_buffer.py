class ThreadBuffer:

    Iterates over values from self.src in a separate thread but yielding them in the current thread. This allows values
    to be queued up asynchronously. The internal thread will continue running so long as the source has values or until
    the stop() method is called.

    One issue raised by using a thread in this way is that during the lifetime of the thread the source object is being
    iterated over, so if the thread hasn't finished another attempt to iterate over it will raise an exception or yield
    unexpected results. To ensure the thread releases the iteration and proper cleanup is done the stop() method must
    be called which will join with the thread.

class ThreadDataLoader(DataLoader):
    """
    Subclass of `DataLoader` using a `ThreadBuffer` object to implement `__iter__` method asynchronously. This will
    iterate over data from the loader as expected however the data is generated on a separate thread. Use this class
    where a `DataLoader` instance is required and not just an iterable object.

    The default behaviour with `repeats` set to 1 is to yield each batch as it is generated, however with a higher
    value the generated batch is yielded that many times while underlying dataset asynchronously generates the next.
    Typically not all relevant information is learned from a batch in a single iteration so training multiple times
    on the same batch will still produce good training with minimal short-term overfitting while allowing a slow batch
    generation process more time to produce a result.
